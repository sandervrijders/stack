RESUME
********************************************************************************

This is a DTCP level policy. It stores the value of the QoS avg. bandwidth as 
the preferred minimum rate at which the flow must be set in case of congestion.
Now this policy assumes a behavior which is inspired by DCTCP strategies: it 
counts how many congested pdus arrives in the single flow and adjust the rate
of this one according to the level of congestion.

Such propotion is inverse proportional between the Minimum Granted Bandwidth
assigned and the reset rate. So, the more the congestion level, the more the 
flow adapt moves it's rate in the MGB direction.

It's also possible to select a direct swap, so that once congestion is 
encountered the flow immediately moves to the MGB.

SYSFS FOR DEBUG/INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

Loading the policy will cause sysfs entries to be spawned under /sys/cdrr.
You can use them to log how everything is going. 

The only value which can be changed using sysfs is 'link_rate', which allows a 
fast change of this limit and of the reset rate.
