RESUME
********************************************************************************
This set of policies will provide a congestion control set of policies which 
allows to take advantage of the rate based flow control to avoid congestions in 
your favourite topology.

The set of policies now allow to take also advantage of the Equal Cost Multi 
Path routing strategy (introduced by ATOS). We just personalized further such
algorithm in order to perform choose between different way of routing on 
multiple paths. 

Whenever congestion happens in an intermediate node, it will mark pdus which
pass through it, leaving other flows free to achieve the desired rate (if they
took different routes).

COMPONENTS
********************************************************************************
- ecn: Explicit Congestion Notification policy.
	a very basic congestion detection RMT policy which starts to mark
	packets as Congested when you start to use the RMT queues.
	
- cdrr: Congestion Detection Rate Reduction policy.
	A DTCP policy which adapts the flows to their average bandwidth when 
	congestion-marked pdus are detected. If no congestion is occurring then 
	it allow the flow to push at a predefined rate that you can set.
		
- fare: Flow Allocation Rate Enforcement policy.
	A FA policy which reads set the flow rate to the average bandwidth 
	requested (which we threat as Minimum Granted Bandwidth).
	
- pffb: Pdu Forwarding Flow Balancing policy.
	This policy offer different way of forwarding. Some of the strategies
	are possible because they expect a DC network with some restriction, 
	while other are just good for every topology.
	
These policies now has become a little more dependant one from the other.
